Welcome! I’m a CSE undergrad from Botswana who completed **AWS re/Start** and earned the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** certification in **October 2025**.  
This repo is my live portfolio — every lab, diagram, script, and lesson learned from zero to certified.

## Journey Timeline
- **Aug–Sep 2025** → AWS Global Infrastructure & S3 static websites  
- **Sep–Oct 2025** → VPC, EC2, IAM, CloudFormation labs  
- **October 2025** → Passed Cloud Practitioner exam  
- **Next goal** → AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (target: Q1 2026)

## Competencies Attained (Job-Ready Skills)
Even though this is a foundational certification, here’s exactly what I can **do right now** in a real AWS environment — proven with screenshots, code, and templates in this repo:

| Competency | What I Can Do | Evidence in Repo |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Cloud Architecture Design** | Design highly available, fault-tolerant architectures using Regions, AZs, and edge locations (Sydney ap-southeast-2 focus) | [01-aws-global-infrastructure](01-aws-global-infrastructure/) – multi-AZ diagram |
| **Secure Networking** | Build isolated VPCs with public/private subnets, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, and route tables | [03-vpc-networking](03-vpc-networking/) – full VPC diagram + CloudFormation YAML |
| **Identity & Access Management** | Implement least-privilege policies, create IAM users/roles, enforce MFA, and audit via CloudTrail | [04-iam-security](04-iam-security/) – custom JSON policies + CloudTrail logs |
| **Cost Optimization** | Use AWS Pricing Calculator, Spot Instances, and Cost Explorer to reduce monthly bills by 30–70% | Cost comparison screenshots + Budget alerts |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Write and deploy CloudFormation templates for repeatable environments | Ready-to-use `.yaml` stacks in each module |
| **Serverless & Storage** | Host static websites on S3 + CloudFront with < 50 ms latency for Australian users | [02-static-website-deployment](02-static-website-deployment/) – live demo link |
| **Monitoring & Troubleshooting** | Set up CloudWatch alarms and interpret basic logs/metrics | Alarm screenshots in labs |
| **Compliance Awareness** | Understand Shared Responsibility Model and retrieve compliance reports via AWS Artifact | Artifact screenshot in security folder |

These are **not just theory** — every skill above has working code, console screenshots, CLI outputs, or diagrams I created myself during AWS re/Start labs using the Free Tier.
