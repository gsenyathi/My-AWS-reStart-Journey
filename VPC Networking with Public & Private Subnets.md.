# AWS VPC Networking with Public & Private Subnets  
**Hands-On Lab | AWS re/Start Journey**

A complete, secure VPC setup incorporating **Public & Private subnets**, **Internet Gateway**, and **NAT Gateway** – the exact pattern used in real production environments.

## Lab Overview 

This lab taught me how to isolate resources using public and private subnets – an important **must-know** skillset for any Cloud Engineer or Solutions Architect role.

### Step 1: Create Custom VPC
**What I did**: Created a new VPC with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`  
**Result**: Isolated network foundation for the entire lab.

```text
VPC ID: vpc-0c832a70e724d9b03
Name: Lab VPC
State: Available

Step 2: Create Public & Private Subnets
What I did:

Public Subnet → 10.0.0.0/24 (for NAT Gateway)
Private Subnet → 10.0.2.0/23 (for secure instances)

Subnets created and visible in console

Step 3: Create & Attach Internet Gateway
What I did:

Created Internet Gateway
Attached it to Lab VPC so the public subnet can reach the internet.

Attaching the Internet Gateway to the VPC
Result: Internet Gateway is now live and attached.
Internet Gateway details – attached and ready

Step 4: Create NAT Gateway (in Public Subnet)
What I did:
Placed NAT Gateway in the public subnet with an Elastic IP.
This allows private instances to download updates without being exposed to inbound traffic.
textNAT Gateway ID: nat-020c35d27308d329
State: Available
Location: Public Subnet (10.0.0.0/24)
NAT Gateway created successfully

Step 5: Route Tables (The Key to Security!)
Public Route Table → 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway (full internet)
Private Route Table → 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway (outbound only)
This separation is why private instances stay secure.
